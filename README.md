# Digilent-Nexys-DDR-4-FPGA-Projects

Here are my projects that I have done in VHDL, and were tested on a Digilent Nexys 4 DDR FPGA to made sure it worked. All the .txt that you see are in VHDL by the way

The Files are separated for the design files, testbenches/simulations, constraints to fit for the Digilent Nexys 4 DDR, and the pictures of each schematic that was created by the VHDL code.

I have videos of it being tested for Labs 1-4 as I didn't have the opportuniy to get it for the 4 to 16 register file, lab 0 and lab 5 but the code still works for them regardless in case you have asked.
